This is a project form the very first course I took. As a pick for the HTML/CSS website I picked the company website, I worked for back then, as I thought It needed improvement. This is the current company website http://www.fcbloxom.com/.
It's a good site but it looked a little bit old fashion to me, and user experience needed to be improved on a commodities page. It has all commodities listed one by one in a long scroll list, and user needs to scroll down for a long time to find something he needs. Moreover, then when he sees the commodity, he doesn't know which of the buyers sells it. I group commodities by departments as they are represented at the company and added name and contact information. I made each department expand on mouse move, bringing up attention. This way JavaScript code to make the site more dynamic.
The company receives many requests for Food Safety Primus Certification, so I created a food safety page and added an image of the certificate and JavaScript allows expanding Image on click.
I am still working on some small design touches and going to present it to the company after.
